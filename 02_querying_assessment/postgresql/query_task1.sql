-- Task 1: Sides Menu Board
-- The owner wants to update the printed menu board that displays only the side dishes.
-- They need a list of every item in the 'Side' category along with its current price,
-- so the designer can produce an accurate board without having to check each item manually.
--
-- Hint: Write a query to find the name and price of all menu items that are in the 'Side' category.

-- Bonus: The dataset is identical in the MongoDB database, meaning the same business insight can be retrieved.
-- Write the equivalent query for MongoDB. See query_task1_bonus.mongodb.js

-- Your thinking process (required)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------
-- Before writing your query, explain in your own words how you
-- interpreted the task, what data you need, which table(s) are
-- involved, and what SQL concepts you plan to use.
-- Write in English or Thai. Do not skip this step.
--
-- Your thinking:
-- 1. SELECT column_name (name, price)
-- 2. use FROM to find name, price in menuItems
-- 3. use WHERE to condition the category 'Side'
select name, price from menuItems
where category = 'Side';
