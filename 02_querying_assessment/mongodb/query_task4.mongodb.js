// Task 4: Total Revenue Summary
// At the end of the trading period, the owner wants a single figure that shows how much revenue
// the truck has generated across all recorded orders. This number will be used in their
// financial summary report, so the result should be returned as a single value named total_revenue.
//
// Hint: Write an aggregation query on the orders collection to calculate the total revenue from all orders combined.
// The result should be a single document with a field named total_revenue.

// Bonus: The dataset is identical in the PostgreSQL database, meaning the same business insight can be retrieved.
// Write the equivalent query for PostgreSQL. See query_task4_bonus.sql

// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// Your thinking process (required)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// Before writing your query, explain in your own words how you
// interpreted the task, what data you need, which collection(s)
// are involved, and what MongoDB concepts you plan to use.
// Write in English or Thai. Do not skip this step.
//
// Your thinking:
// 1. use ("chrome-burger-db") database
// 2. choose collection = orders
// 3. use AGGREGATE to transform data set into stages
// 4. use $group to choose data that we want to group
// 5. use $sum to find summary of total_price and collect in total_revenue key
// 6. use $project to show only data we want
use("chrome-burger-db");

db.orders.aggregate([
    {$group: {_id: null, total_revenue: {$sum: "$total_price"} } },
    {$project: {_id: 0, total_revenue: 1} }
]);
