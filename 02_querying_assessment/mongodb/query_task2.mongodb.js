// Task 2: Shift Activity Report
// Jane Doe has an upcoming performance review and the manager wants to look at her order history
// ahead of the meeting. They only need to see when each order was placed and what it was worth —
// no other details are required for this particular review.
//
// Hint: Write a query to find all orders handled by the staff member "Jane Doe".
// Your query should only return the order_date and total_price fields for these orders.

// Bonus: The dataset is identical in the PostgreSQL database, meaning the same business insight can be retrieved.
// Write the equivalent query for PostgreSQL. See query_task2_bonus.sql

// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// Your thinking process (required)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// Before writing your query, explain in your own words how you
// interpreted the task, what data you need, which collection(s)
// are involved, and what MongoDB concepts you plan to use.
// Write in English or Thai. Do not skip this step.
//
// Your thinking:
// 1. use ("chrome-burger-db") database
// 2. choose collection = orders
// 3. use FIND to find the result
// 4. choose staff.first_name: and staff.last_name
// 5. projection result only order_date and total_price
use("chrome-burger-db");

db.orders.find(
    {"staff.first_name": "Jane", "staff.last_name": "Doe"},
    {order_date: 1, total_price: 1}
);
